        <p id="celticbio"> The Boston Celtics have had a long-standing reputation of being a decorated team in the NBA. Seventeen banners hang in their stadium, a welcome site for their fans, ever representing the endless moments of success and triumph since 1957. They
          have also, however, seen their fair share of tense and heart-breaking moments. From the recent injury of Gordon Hayward to the departure of franchise players like Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, Celtic fans have seen it all. </p>

        <h2 class="lakerbio"> Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
        <p class="lakerbio"> When it comes to NBA royalty and prestige, the Lakers take the crown. With sixteen championship titles under their belt and legendary players like Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson, the Lakers have always been one of the most exciting teams in the
          league. Memorable lineups like the Showtime Lakers and the Kobe-Shaq duo, have always proven to stay standing by the end of the season. Even during rough patches, the Lakers franchise still remains to be one of the most memorable.</p>
